# Santa’s Magic Juice Bottling Challenge

Santa and the elves have made a huge amount of **Magic Holiday Juice** from freshly harvested apples. They need your help to figure out how to bottle the juice correctly.

The juice can be filled into:

- 5-liter festive barrels
- 2-liter elf jugs
- 1-liter reindeer flasks

Each elf bottles juice using this rule:

1. Fill as many 5-liter barrels as possible
2. Then fill 2-liter jugs
3. Put the remaining juice into 1-liter flasks

## Your Task

Write a program that:

- Stores the juice amounts in an array or object.
- For each elf, calculates how many 5L, 2L, and 1L containers they will use.
- Prints the results in the format:

```bash
fiveLiter twoLiter oneLiter
```

One line per elf.

## Input (given directly in code)

```typescript
// Example data
const juiceAmounts = [45, 92, 33];
```

or

```typescript
const elves = [
  { name: "Sparkle", liters: 45 },
  { name: "Twinkle", liters: 92 },
  { name: "Jingle", liters: 33 }
];
```

## Expected Output Format

For each elf:

```bash
number_of_5L_barrels number_of_2L_jugs number_of_1L_flasks
```

## Example with the given data

Data:

```typescript
[45, 92, 33]
```

Output:

```bash
9 0 0
18 1 0
6 1 1
```

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
npx ts-node cli.ts
```
