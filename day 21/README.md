# Christmas Library Task

Just before Christmas, a small town library is preparing for the holidays. Many readers want to borrow books to enjoy during long winter evenings. The librarian needs a **simple program** to manage books, readers, and loans.

Your task is to help the librarian by creating a **Christmas Library System** using **object-oriented programming.**

The task must be suitable for **Python, C#, JavaScript, and Java.**

## What the program should do

The library must be able to:

- store information about books,
- register readers,
- lend books to readers,
- accept returned books,
- print a festive report of the library’s current state.

All data is provided **directly in the code** (no files).

## Objects to implement

### Book

Represents a book on the library shelf.

Fields:

- id
- title
- author
- totalCopies – total number of copies
- availableCopies – copies currently available

Methods:

- isAvailable() → returns true if at least one copy is available

Rules:

- availableCopies cannot be negative
- availableCopies cannot exceed totalCopies

### Reader

Represents a library reader.

Fields:

- id
- name
- borrowLimit (e.g. 3 books)
- borrowedBookIds (list or set)

Methods:

- canBorrow() → returns true if the reader has not reached the limit

### Loan

Represents a borrowed book.

Fields:

- id
- bookId
- readerId
- loanDate
- returnDate (nullable)
- status – ACTIVE or RETURNED

### Library

The main class that manages everything.

Fields:

- books (collection of Book)
- readers (collection of Reader)
- loans (collection of Loan)

Methods:

- addBook(book)
- registerReader(reader)
- borrowBook(readerId, bookId, date)
  - creates and returns a Loan
  - fails if:
    - book or reader does not exist
    - no available copies
    - reader reached borrow limit
- returnBook(loanId, date)
- getActiveLoans()
- printChristmasReport()

## Christmas Scenario

Create the following data inside the program:

### Books

- “Clean Code” – 2 copies
- “The Pragmatic Programmer” – 1 copy
- “Refactoring” – 1 copy

### Readers

- Alice (borrow limit 2)
- Bob (borrow limit 1)

### Actions

1. Alice borrows Clean Code
2. Alice borrows Clean Code again
3. Bob tries to borrow Clean Code (should fail – no copies)
4. Alice returns one copy of Clean Code
5. Print the final Christmas report

### Example output (suggested)

```bash
BORROW OK: Alice borrowed "Clean Code"
BORROW OK: Alice borrowed "Clean Code"
BORROW FAILED: Bob cannot borrow "Clean Code" (no copies available)
RETURN OK: "Clean Code" returned by Alice

CHRISTMAS LIBRARY REPORT
Clean Code: 1 / 2 available
The Pragmatic Programmer: 1 / 1 available
Refactoring: 1 / 1 available

ACTIVE LOANS
Alice → Clean Code
```

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
npx ts-node cli.ts
```
