# Santa’s Magical ASCII Countdown 🎅✨

Santa Claus is preparing for his Christmas Eve flight, but before the sleigh lifts off the ground, he must complete a magical countdown from 10 to 0. The countdown must be displayed in big ASCII-art numbers, using the provided DIGITS array.

Your task is to help Santa launch his sleigh!

## Task Requirements

Create a program that:

1. Starts a countdown from **10 down to 0**.
2. Each second:

- Clears the screen.
- Displays the current number using the ASCII art from the `DIGITS` array.
- Shows a festive message, such as:
  - "Santa is preparing…"
  - "Reindeer are buckling up…"
  - "Sleigh warming up…"

3. When the countdown reaches 0, display:

SANTA’S SLEIGH IS LAUNCHING!

---

## Expected Output Example (simplified)

Timer: 5

<ASCII art for number 5>

Sleigh warming up...

And finally:

<ASCII art for number 0>

🎅✨SANTA’S SLEIGH IS LAUNCHING!✨🎅
