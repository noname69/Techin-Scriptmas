# Santa’s Sleigh Flight Schedule

Santa’s magical sleigh takes off from the North Pole at **a hours** and **b minutes**. The sleigh stays in the air for **c minutes** delivering presents.

Write a program that calculates:

* **v** — the hour when Santa lands
* **m** — the minute when Santa lands

Keep in mind that **c can be large**, meaning Santa might land **after midnight**, on the next day!

Example: If Santa takes off at **a = 23, b = 55**, and the flight lasts **c = 14 minutes**, then Santa will land at:

* **v = 0 hours**
* **m = 9 minutes**

Help Santa keep his schedule on time—Christmas depends on it!
