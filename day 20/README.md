# Santa’s Christmas Call Center – Billing Task

Every December, Santa runs a special **North Pole Call Center** where elves make phone calls to children around the world to confirm their Christmas wishes.

At the end of the month, Santa must prepare a magical call bill for each elf.

Your task is to help Santa calculate how much each elf must pay for their calls (in candy canes or Christmas coins).

## Task Description

Santa has a list of elves. For each elf, you know:

- **first name**
- **last name**
- **a list of calls they made** (each call contains: cityName, minutesTalked)

Santa also has a **price list**, where for every city you know the price per minute.

Your program must:

1. Calculate the total cost of calls for each elf.
2. Sort all elves alphabetically by last name.
3. Print the billing report, showing:
    - elf’s first name
    - elf’s last name
    - total cost of calls (rounded to 2 decimals)
4. Finally, print:
    - the total money collected from all elves.

## Input (stored directly in code)

Example data:

```javascript
const elves = [
  {
    firstName: "Jingle",
    lastName: "Sparkfoot",
    calls: [
      { city: "London", minutes: 12 },
      { city: "Paris", minutes: 7 }
    ]
  },
  {
    firstName: "Twinkle",
    lastName: "Icicletoes",
    calls: [
      { city: "NewYork", minutes: 20 },
      { city: "London", minutes: 5 }
    ]
  },
  {
    firstName: "Pudding",
    lastName: "Gumdrops",
    calls: [
      { city: "Paris", minutes: 15 }
    ]
  }
];
```

```javascript
const priceList = {
  London: 0.50,
  Paris: 0.40,
  NewYork: 0.70
};
```

Output Example:

```bash
Gumdrops Pudding 6.00
Icicletoes Twinkle 16.50
Sparkfoot Jingle 9.50
Total: 32.00
```

(Names sorted alphabetically by last name.)
