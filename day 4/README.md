# Gift Bag

Santa Claus is preparing his gift bag and checking the prices of different toys. The toy prices (real numbers) are entered from the keyboard. When **0** is entered, it means the magical toy list is finished.

## Write a program that

- **Calculates the total price of all toys** that cost more than **10 EUR** (because the more expensive toys are usually extra magical!).
- **Determines and outputs** how many such special toys Santa has added to his bag.

## Example (Santa’s list)

### Input

`5.6; 6.7; 12.3; 15.7; 0`

### Output should be

```shell
Total price of magical toys: 28.0 EUR
Number of magical toys: 2
```
