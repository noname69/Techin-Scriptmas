# Santa’s Number-Trimming Magic

Santa has a four-digit number written on his list. He wants to create a new two-digit number by removing the two middle digits from the original number — a little Christmas magic to help shorten his naughty-and-nice records!

Your job is to write a program that performs this transformation.

Example: If Santa’s number is **1235**, then the new number should be **15**.

Help Santa tidy up his list before Christmas Eve!
