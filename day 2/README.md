# Santa’s Midnight Clock Countdown
Santa’s magical workshop clock shows **x hours** and **y minutes**. Write a program that calculates:

- **m** — how many minutes have passed since midnight
- **s** — how many seconds have passed since midnight

### Example: If the clock shows **x = 3** and **y = 5**, then:

Minutes passed: **m = 185**

Seconds passed: **s = 11100**

Help Santa keep track of time before the Christmas rush begins!
