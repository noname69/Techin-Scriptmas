# Peter’s Christmas Shopping Dilemma

Peter wants to buy *one* Christmas gift. He has three options:

- A **book** costing x euros
- A **music CD** costing y euros
- A **USB memory stick** costing z euros

Peter will always buy the **cheapest** of the three items.

Your task is to determine **how much money Peter will spend**.

## Input

Three real numbers (decimals), each on the same line or separated by spaces:

- x – price of the book in euros
- y – price of the CD in euros
- z – price of the USB stick in euros

## Output

Print one real number – the smallest of the three prices.

You may:

- print it with two decimal places, e.g. 7.24
- optionally add text like Peter will spend 7.24.

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
npx ts-node cli.ts <x> <y> <z>
```
### Arguments

- `<x>` - price one
- `<y>` - price two
- `<z>` - price three

### Example

```bash
npx ts-node cli.ts 5.5 2.2 7.38
```

### Output

```bash
2.2
```
