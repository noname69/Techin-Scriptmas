# Santa’s Gift Audit

Santa Claus has just finished visiting all the workshops at the North Pole! Each workshop is run by a team of elves, and each elf is responsible for producing a certain number of gifts.

Your task is to help Santa **count gifts using nested loops.**

## Task Description
There are **W workshops**. In each workshop, there are **E elves**. Every elf produced **G gifts**, but the amount varies per elf.

You are given a 2D structure (array of arrays) where:

- Each **row** represents a workshop
- Each **column** represents an elf
- Each **number** represents how many gifts that elf produced

## Your task

Using a **loop inside a loop**, calculate:

1. For every workshop:
    - Workshop number
    - Total number of gifts made in that workshop
2. After processing all workshops:
    - Total number of gifts made in all workshops combined

## Input (data provided directly in code)

```typescript
[
  [5, 7, 3],     // Workshop 1: 3 elves
  [6, 4, 4, 5],  // Workshop 2: 4 elves
  [10, 2]        // Workshop 3: 2 elves
]
```

## Output example

```bash
Workshop 1 made 15 gifts
Workshop 2 made 19 gifts
Workshop 3 made 12 gifts
Santa’s total gift count is 46
```

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
