# Santa’s Christmas Concert Seating Plan

Santa is organizing a big Christmas concert, and the architect has designed a hall with **n rows of seats**.

- In the **first row**, there will be **k seats**.
- Every next row will have **2 more seats** than the row before it (because more elves want a good view!).

Write a program that calculates **s**, the **total number of seats** Santa must order to match the architect’s seating plan.

Example: If **n = 3** rows and the first row has **k = 8** seats, then the total number of seats should be: **s = 30** seats

Help Santa make sure every elf gets a spot at the show!
